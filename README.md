# socialNetworkAPI

## Description

This project was done in order to create a API backend without the use of SQL. Tis project was done so as to better learn mongoDb and how routes can be used to view, create, and update data on a mongoDb server. Through this project I have gained a much better understanding express node calls, mongoDb, and model calls.
